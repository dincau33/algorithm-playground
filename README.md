# Algorithm Playground

Coursera Algorithm I / II are excellent introduction to elementary data structures and algorithms.
In this repository I reimplement the most common algorithms from scratch to validate my understanding of the courses.

This repository contains:
* The unit tests I use to assert whether my algorithms implementation are correct or not.
Be mindful the tests do not cover time and space complexity assertion but only correctness.
* My solution to common problems where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms introduced in the course is useful.

# How to build
`mvn clean test` compile project, run checkstyle, findbugs, PMD, jacoco and execute unit tests.
