# Algorithm Playground

Coursera Algorithm I / II are excellent introduction to elementary data structures and algorithms.
In this repository I validate my understanding by reimplementing the most common algorithms from scratch.

This repository contains:
* The unit tests I used to validate whether algorithms implementation are correct or not.
Be mindful the tests does not cover time and space complexity assessment but only correctness.
* My solution to common problems where the knowledge of common data structures and algorithms introduced in the course is useful.

# How to build
`mvn clean test` compile project, run checkstyle, findbugs, PMD, jacoco and execute unit tests.
